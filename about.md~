Welcome to my website! My name is Jungo Kasai, a senior at Yale University from Japan majoring in statistics. I am currently conducting a research project in Natural Language Processing under the guidance of Professor [Robert Frank](http://whitney.ling.yale.edu/~rfrank/Bob_Frank/Home.html), Chair of  the Department of Linguistics at Yale and Dr. [Owen Rambow](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rambow/) at Columbia. I am also working on a project on multi-lingual word embedding with Professor [Dragomir Radev](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/) at the Department of Computer Science at Yale. I am a member of the [LILY Lab](https://yale-lily.github.io/), the [Yale Data Science](https://yaledatascience.github.io/), and the [CLAY Lab](http://ling.yale.edu/research/computational-linguistics-yale-clay). I enjoy reading philosophy books and studying Mandarin Chinese. 

This website is my workspace that I mostly write takeaways from reading papers on machine learning and statistics.
